# What is mixBASE?
**mixBASE** (mixbase.app) is a music hosting and release platform for independent artists — think SoundCloud but with real version management and a full production workflow built in. Tagline: *"Rough-to-release."*

**What it does today:**
- Host songs with artwork and manage multiple versions of a track (rough mix → final master)
- A/B compare versions, annotate with notes, share publicly for feedback
- Generate artwork (Flux/Imagen via Replicate) and visualizer videos (Runway Gen-3)
- Release pipeline: a checklist of tasks to complete before releasing a song

**The vision — one-click release:**
The release pipeline is currently a manual checklist. The end goal is full automation: one button press submits the song to a streaming distributor, completes every checklist item automatically (metadata, artwork, ISRC, etc.), and ships the release with zero artist effort. Everything between "rough demo" and "live on Spotify" should be handled by mixBASE.

Built by moodmixformat, LLC.

# Automation First
- **Never tell the user "you'll need to do this manually."** Use available tools to do it directly.
- **Never say you can't do something** without first attempting it with the tools available.
- **USE THE CLI BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO USE CHROME PLUGINS**

# Deployment
- **Production URL: https://mixbase.app**
- Railway production (main): https://mixbase-production.up.railway.app
- Railway staging (tst): https://mixbase-staging.up.railway.app
- Supabase project: mdefkqaawrusoaojstpq (mmf-agents, us-east-1)
- Supabase URL: https://mdefkqaawrusoaojstpq.supabase.co

## Dev Commands
```bash
npm run dev       # Start local dev server (port 3000)
npm run build     # Production build (run before pushing)
npm run lint      # ESLint check
node scripts/test-upload.mjs https://mixbase-staging.up.railway.app
```

## Required Environment Variables
| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | **Yes** | Admin DB access, auth validation, bypasses file size limits |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | No | Falls back to hardcoded project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | No | Falls back to hardcoded public key |
| `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` | Optional | Artwork generation (Flux 2 Pro / Imagen 4 via Replicate) |
| `RUNWAY_API_KEY` | Optional | Visualizer video generation (Runway Gen-3) |
| `SUPABASE_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN` | Optional | DB schema init via `/api/db-init` |

# Architecture: Critical Constraints — READ BEFORE TOUCHING UPLOADS OR AUDIO

## Upload — Never Route File Bytes Through Railway
Railway's proxy truncates request bodies above 10 MB (10,485,760 bytes exactly). This is infrastructure, not a code bug.

**Active path — Signed URL (used in ProjectClient.tsx):**
- `POST /api/upload-url` — server generates a short-lived Supabase signed upload URL
- Browser PUTs directly to Supabase — Railway is never in the byte path

**Also available — TUS chunked proxy (resumable):**
- `POST /api/tus` — creates TUS session at Supabase using service-role key (bypasses anon 50 MB limit)
- `PATCH /api/tus/<uploadId>` — proxies one 8 MB chunk (under Railway's 10 MB wall)
- `HEAD /api/tus/<uploadId>` — checks resume offset
- Client: `tus-js-client`, `endpoint: '/api/tus'`, `chunkSize: 8 * 1024 * 1024`

## Audio Range Requests — always use audioProxyUrl()
Supabase audio URLs don't reliably return `Accept-Ranges` — browsers can't seek or determine duration without it.

- `src/app/api/audio/[...path]/route.ts` — proxy that forwards Range headers, returns proper 206 responses
- `audioProxyUrl(supabaseUrl)` in `src/lib/supabase.ts` — converts Supabase mf-audio URL to `/api/audio/...`
- Every `<audio>` element or `WaveformPlayer` MUST use `audioProxyUrl(version.audio_url)`, not the raw URL
- Applied in: `ProjectClient.tsx`, `ShareClient.tsx`, `player/page.tsx` — do not revert

## Supabase Storage Buckets
- `mf-audio` — audio files, public read
- `mf-artwork` — artwork images, public read

# Auth Model
Multi-user with Supabase Auth (email + password). `POST /api/auth` signs in and sets `sb-access-token` + `sb-refresh-token` cookies. `POST /api/auth/signup` creates accounts. Middleware validates via `supabaseAdmin.auth.getUser()` and injects `X-User-Id`. All tables have RLS enforcing per-user isolation.

Public routes (no auth): `/login`, `/signup`, `/privacy`, `/support`, `/terms`, `/dmca`, `/share/`, `/api/auth`, `/api/audio`, `/api/health`, `/api/tus`, `/api/feedback`

# Application Pages
- `/dashboard` — Project grid with stats, activity feed
- `/projects/[id]` — Versions, upload, A/B compare, notes, release pipeline
- `/collections` — Group tracks into playlists/EPs/albums
- `/media` — Artwork gallery across all projects
- `/pipeline` — Release checklist board
- `/player` — Full-screen audio player with waveform
- `/share/[token]` — Public share page with feedback form (no auth)

## PWA + iOS Wrapper
Do not remove `ServiceWorkerRegistrar.tsx`, `PullToRefresh.tsx`, or `appleWebApp` metadata in `layout.tsx`. Native iOS wrapper lives in `ios/` (Xcode project).
